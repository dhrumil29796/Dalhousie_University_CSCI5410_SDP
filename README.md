## Final Group Project
* Project Description: DALSoft5410 is building a serverless SafeDeposit using multi-cloud deployment model, and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). The SafeDeposit, should provide customization feature, and additional services for authorized users, and limited services to guests. The SafeDeposit should provide an online virtual assistance, which can quickly answer the queries of users, and in addition, it should provide a message passing functionality between the authorized users.
